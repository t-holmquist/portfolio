                                  my own personal style. I thought it would be interesting to showcase the design and development of the portfolio itself
                                  as it is a pretty interesting project on its own. Below are a few highlight from the process and how this site came to be.`,

                                    on the case subpage. This makes it easy to quickly get an overview of the different projects and saves a lot of back-and-forth. 
                                    I think it came out pretty elegantly.`,

        aboutProjectDescription: `Our team of students were assigned to choose a company that had, or could have had, a circular product and economy, so we chose Nespresso.
                                  Nespresso wants to recycle their coffee capsules and have specific goals they want to achieve. So we created a set of advertisements and redesigned their recycling webpage
                                  to create a significant better user experience. We also invented a new Nespresso points reward system targeted and incentivized towards users already in the Nespresso ecosystem.
                                  The more you return and recycle, the more points and discount you get off your favorite products - that was the idea. With a better UX-design and specific ads that leads to our redesigned landingpage, 
                                  the last step was to test our product against real users. This was out of scope for the current school project, although we did adjust our design and ads based on internal feedback.`,

                                  We might have kept it even more on brand than Nespresso itself, since some of their pages were oddly off brand, which might be due to an upcoming update of their visual identity`,
