                                could enjoy concerts and various activities during the day. We created a landingpage to sell 
                                tickest and provide all the practical information needed to attend to festival.
                                Our target audience were students at cphbusiness and the desired action of the landingpage was to
                                make the students purchase the festival ticket. We structured the website with the Inverted Pyramid
                                and AIDA-model in mind, so that the concerts we're placed at the top to get the users attention.
                                The rest of the practical information then came after.`,

                               we wanted decided to create the fictive scenario that he created a Anniversary Vinyl with
                              all the profits going to Greenpeace and other sustainability partners. We created a landingpage and Instagram AD
                              that primarily targeted Ludovico fans and also people who valued sustainability.
                              As part of the campaign, we designed the Vinyl he wanted to sell, the Instagram AD that leads to our landingpage and
                              Spotify cover/banner and ads in the public space.`,
