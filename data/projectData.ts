                                could enjoy concerts and various activities during the day. We created a landingpage to sell 
                                tickest and provide all the practical information needed to attend to festival.
                                Our target audience were students at cphbusiness and the desired action of the landingpage was to
                                make the students purchase the festival ticket. We structured the website with the Inverted Pyramid
                                and AIDA-model in mind, so that the concerts we're placed at the top to get the users attention.
                                The rest of the practical information then came after.`,

                              all the profits going to Greenpeace and other sustainability partners. We created a landingpage and Instagram AD
                              that primarily targeted Ludovico fans and also people who valued sustainability.
                              As part of the campaign, we designed the Vinyl he wanted to sell, the Instagram AD that leads to our landingpage and

                                  Nespresso wants to recycle their coffee capsules and have specific goals they want to achieve. So we created a set of advertisements and redesigned their recycling webpage
                                  to create a significant better user experience. We also invented a new Nespresso points reward system targeted and incentivized towards users already in the Nespresso ecosystem.
                                  The more you return and recycle, the more points and discount you get off your favorite products - that was the idea. With a better UX-design and specific ads that leads to our redesigned landingpage, 
                                  the last step was to test our product against real users. This was out of scope for the current school project, although we did adjust our design and ads based on internal feedback.`,
